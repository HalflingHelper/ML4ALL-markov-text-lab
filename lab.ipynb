    "## The Idea\n",
    "We want to choose the next word to use in a sequence of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Chains\n",
    "Markov chains are a useful tool for this task. They\n",
    "describe a sequence of probabilistic events, where\n",
    "each event depends only on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Markov-Chains-in-NLP.webp\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the theory and applications of \n",
    "markov chains on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our use case, we care about the \"state\" as being the previous\n",
    "words in the sentence. For example, consider us predicting\n",
    "the next word in the following sentence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "For dinner, we will eat ___\n",
    "```\n",
    "Our state for predicting the last word of this sentence\n",
    "is \"eat\", and in choosing what comes next, we will only\n",
    "consider words that can come after eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Grams\n",
    "Clearly using one word to predict the next isn't ideal. For \n",
    "example, consider:\n",
    "```\n",
    "My favorite baseball team is the ___.\n",
    "```\n",
    "If our state is just \"the\", there are so many words that\n",
    "can come next. Is it `the pizza`, `the St. Louis Cardinals`, \n",
    "`the Indianapolis Colts`? Many of these options aren't ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that can mitigate this issue is using more than just one\n",
    "word to predict the next. If our state is \"baseball team is the\",\n",
    "then there are much fewer options for what can come next.\n",
    "\n",
    "These groupings of subsequent words are called *N-grams*,\n",
    "and are used commonly in NLP to capture information about word\n",
    "order. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)\n",
    "\n",
    "But be careful! If too many words are used to predict the next,\n",
    "then we run the risk of just reproducing the training input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature\n",
    "Another question is about how deterministic our model should be.\n",
    "That is: given some starting state, should we always generate the same thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is known as temperature. At a temperature of 0, the\n",
    "model will always choose the most likely option, and as it increases\n",
    "the probabilities become increasingly equally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes described as representing how \"creative\" a model\n",
    "will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO: This equation isn't great: I -->\n",
    "$$P_i = \\frac{e^\\frac{y_i}{T}}{\\sum_{k=1}^ne^\\frac{y_k}{T}}$$"
